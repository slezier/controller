// Do not issue any commands until given an Id
// (Except for Cable Check and IdRequestCommand)

// Initiated by the master whenever an animation id should modify it's state
// Then after the leaf slave node receives the command, send it back to the master
// On the way back, each device can begin the animation adjustment
//
// The master->leaf command should indicate to each device that it should finish sending the
// current slave->master data and wait for the leaf->master command
